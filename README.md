# ⚽ PremierLeaguePredictor

A Python-based machine learning project that predicts **English Premier League (EPL)** standings using historical match data, team statistics, and player performance metrics.

The project focuses on building a reliable **backend prediction engine first**, with plans to add a **user interface (UI)** after the modeling phase is complete.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies machine learning techniques to analyze past EPL seasons and generate predictions for future league standings. The goal is to combine sports analytics, data engineering, and ML modeling into a scalable system.
